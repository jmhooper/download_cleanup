I don't like living out of my Downloads folder. This repository helps me by providing a service that deletes the contents of my downloads overnight.

It is easy to install when you are setting up a new MacOS machine:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmhooper/download_cleanup/install.sh | bash
```
